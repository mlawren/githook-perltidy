    Packaging:
        - Restore App/githook_perltidy.pm as App::githook_perltidy
          doesn't seem to be indexed from lib/App/githook/perltidy.pm.

        - Remove implementation of the depreciated MAKE ARGS feature
        - Remove implementation of legacy post-commit command

    Bug Fixes:
        - Restore the usage: message name back to "githook-perltidy"
          which was broken (showed as just perltidy") by the move to
          App::githook::perltidy.
        - Correctly deal with spaces in the filesystem path to

0.12.0 (2018-08-02)

    Packaging:
        - Generate t/githook-perltidy with generic subroutine

0.11.11_4 (2018-07-31)

    New Features:
        - Tidy files which are copied or moved by the commit. That
          these were not tidied was an oversight from the very
          beginning.

    Enhancements:
        - Make --verbose messages actually useful

    Bug Fixes:
        - Remove debug usleep() call introduced in 0.11.5_2. Do I get
          to call that a performance improvement? :-/

    Dependencies:
        - Instead of recommending Perl::Tidy::Sweetened make it a
          suggestion and also suggest Perl::Critic.
        - Require Perl::Tidy::Sweetened and Perl::Critic on "develop".

    Packaging:
        - Transition to App::githook::perltidy away from
          App::githook_perltidy to match the distribution name.

0.11.11_3 (2018-07-31)

    Enhancements:
        - Documentation updates
        - Performance improvements:
            - Move instead of copy tidied files back to working tree.
            - Only call git-checkout-index once per commit instead of
              once per committed file.
            - Only call git-add once per commit instead of once per
              committed file.

0.11.11_2 (2018-07-27)

    New Features:
        - Add support for Perl::Critic checks

    Enhancements:
        - Minor documentation updates
        - Minor code clarity improvements
        - Skip checks when NO_GITHOOK_PERLTIDY is set
        - Finish faster when no tidying needed

    Dependencies:
        - Add Perl::Tidy::Sweetened as a runtime "recommends"
          dependency.

    Packaging:
        - Renamed development branch "devel" to "master" and now just
          have a single "dist" branch for distributions. Now visitors
          to Github will see current development history first thing
          instead of searching around for a strange branch scheme.

0.11.11_1 (2018-07-17)

    New Features:
        - Add support for Perl::Tidy::Sweetened inspired by a patch by
          Mark Grimes (MGRIMES)

    Enhancements:
        - Use Test::TempDir::Tiny instead of home-grown temp directory
          code.
        - Minor code refactoring

    Packaging:
        - Use META-SPEC version 2 and add Github repository URLs.

0.11.10 (2018-07-14)

    Packaging:
        - Return to the original distribution name of
          App-githook-perltidy with a package name of
          App::githook_perltidy. Seems that I can't change anything
          without losing PAUSE history or permissions.

0.11.9 (2018-07-13)

    Packaging:
        - Revert back to the old distribution name of
          App::githook_perltidy. Otherwise CPAN/PAUSE would require
          githook::perltidy to exist and I'm not sure the community
          wants Apps in that namespace.

0.11.8 (2018-07-13)

    API / Behaviour Changes:
        - Re-named .readme_from_pod -> .readme_from

    Enhancements:

0.11.7_1 (2018-07-13)

    API / Behaviour Changes:
        - Remove documentation references to the MAKE ARGS feature
          which will be depreciated in the future.

    New Features:
        - Automatic README generation from a tidied POD file

    Enhancements:
        - Easier to understand tests

    Packaging:
        - Change distribution name to githook-perltidy instead of
          App::githook_perltidy. Not sure if CPAN allows that, but that
          is what trail distributions are for.

0.11.6 (2018-06-28)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Correctly generate usage message when passed an invalid
          COMMAND argument.

0.11.5 (2018-06-27)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Fix broken podtidy for partial file commits

    Packaging:
        - Ensure all tests are run (recursively) and not just the
          top-level one
        - Fix up my surname in Makefile.PL meta data

0.11.5_2 (2018-06-27)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Robust Perl::Tidy error detection instead of hackiness

    Dependencies:
        - Upgraded from OptArgs to OptArgs2 (0.0.10).
        - Nothing exported with Exporter::Tidy anymore

    Packaging:
        - Convert Makefile.PL from Module::Install to
          ExtUtils::MakeMaker plus a cpanfile.

0.11.5_1 (2017-04-28)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Don't raise an exception for erroneous Perl::Tidy errors

    Other:
        - Hide the post-commit command in the usage message and give it
          even less emphasis in the documentation.
        - Stop Makefile.PL from complaining about not being able to
          detect the perl version.
        - Do not index any package on CPAN except App::githook_perltidy
        - Replace File::Slurp with Path::Tiny (only used in tests)

0.11.4 (2016-05-26)

    Other:
        - No longer install a post-commit hook (unecessary since
          0.11.3_1) but we keep the post-commit command as a no-op for
          backwards compatability with existing installations.

0.11.3_2 (2016-05-21)

    Dependencies:
        - Don't use the defined-or "//" operator - min perl version
          5.6.

0.11.3_1 (2016-05-20)

    Bug Fixes:
       - Fix license typo in Makefile.PL (Mohammad S Anwar)
       - Replace backup/recover (stash/pop) implementation with setting
         GIT_WORK_TREE to a temporary directory. This should fix
         https://github.com/mlawren/githook-perltidy/issues/8.

0.11.2 (2016-01-20)

    New Features:
        - Added a "--force" option to install, to overwrite existing
          git hooks

    Enhancements:
        - Use Path::Tiny everywhere instead of File::Spec::Functions
        - Convert to OptArgs
        - More robust tests
        - Reduce testing noise:
            - Do not build on systems without a git.
            - Do run run make tests on systems without a make.
        - Detect plenv scripts as Perl

    Bug Fixes:
        - Full-path issue:
          https://github.com/mlawren/githook-perltidy/issues/3
        - Allow multiple 'make' arguments
        - Properly handle paths with spaces or other odd characters
          (thanks to Finn Smith)

0.10.2 (2012-06-27)

    Enhancements:
        - Tidying of POD is now optional. Pod::Tidy will only be called
          if .podtidy-opts exists (and is in the repository)

    Bug Fixes:
        - Replace lost verbosity with internal *::Tidy calls

0.10.1 (2012-05-06)

    Enhancements:
        - Use Pod::Tidy directly instead of calling out to podtidy(1)
        - Use Perl::Tidy directly instead of calling out to perltidy(1)

0.10.0 (2012-05-06)

    New Features:
        - Support a project-wide ".podtidy-opts" file

0.9.3 (2012-05-05)

        - Initial tests added.

    Bug Fixes:
        - IMPORTANT! Actually do what the documentation claims:
