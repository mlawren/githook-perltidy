NAME
    githook-perltidy - run perltidy and podtidy before Git commits

VERSION
    0.11.11_2 (yyyy-mm-dd)

SYNOPSIS
        githook-perltidy COMMAND [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
    githook-perltidy is a script designed to run from a Git pre-commit hook.
    It ensures that your Perl and POD files are always cleanly commited by
    running perltidy (Perl::Tidy) and podtidy (Pod::Tidy) on them.

    This script is is efficient: it only modifies files that are being
    committed and not every file in your repository. It also tries its hardest
    to be safe: tidying is performed in a temporary location so that your own
    working files are not left in a bad state in the event of failure.

  Repository Setup
    Before you can use githook-perltidy you need to make sure everyone working
    on your code uses the the same tidy options:

        $ perltidy -b -w -dop | grep -v dump-options > .perltidyrc
        $ echo '--columns 72' > .podtidy-opts
        $ echo '^\.perltidyrc' >> MANIFEST.SKIP
        $ echo '^\.podtidy-ops' >> MANIFEST.SKIP
        $ git add .perltidyrc .podtidy-opts MANIFEST.SKIP
        $ git commit -m 'githook-perltidy support' && git push

  Sweeter Tidying
    You may prefer to tidy with Perl::Tidy::Sweetened instead of plain
    Perl::Tidy. To enable that you commit a .perltidyrc.sweetened file instead
    of .perltidyrc. githook-perltidy does not depend on Perl::Tidy::Sweetend
    directly so you will want to add that as an explicit "develop" dependency
    in your cpanfile, Makefile.PL or Build.PL.

  Automatic README from POD
    githook-perltidy also has an automatic README-from-POD feature. To enable
    it you create and commit a file called .readme_from containing the name of
    a source file containing POD text:

        $ echo 'lib/Your/App.pm' > .readme_from
        $ echo '^\.readme_from' >> MANIFEST.SKIP
        $ git add .readme_from MANIFEST.SKIP
        $ git commit -m 'githook-perltidy readme_from' && git push

    With the above in place the README file will be updated (and potentially
    committed) whenever lib/Your/App.pm is committed.

  githook-perltidy install [--force, -f]
    Anyone making commits in a setup repository should ensure githook-perltidy
    runs from their pre-commit script. The "install" command can be used to
    create one, and must be run from the top-level directory of your
    repository. It writes a pre-commit file in the $GIT_DIR/hooks/ directory.

        $ githook-perltidy install
        $ cat .git/hooks/pre-commit
        #!/bin/sh
        /usr/local/bin/githook-perltidy pre-commit

    This command fails if there is no .perltidyrc or .perltidyrc.sweetened
    file in the repository or if the hooks directory isn't found. It will also
    fail if the Git pre-commit already file exists, unless "--force" is used.

  githook-perltidy pre-commit
    The "pre-commit" command loops through the Git index, checking out
    Perl/POD files to a temporary working directory. It runs perltidy on the
    temporary Perl files using .perltidyrc or .perltidyrc.sweetened. If
    .podtidy-opts exists then podtidy is also run on Perl and POD files. The
    Git index is updated along with your original working files.

    A tidying error stops the script (and therefore the commit) immediately.
    Any successful cleanups to the index and working tree up until that point
    remain in place.

    This command fails if there is no .perltidyrc or .perltidyrc.sweetened
    file in the repository.

    If .readme_from exists and the file named therein is tidied, then
    githook-perltidy translates it with Pod::Text into a new README file. If
    the README file is tracked by Git then it is also added it to the index
    for committing.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --verbose, -v
        Print underlying Git commands or filesystem actions as they are run.

CAVEATS
    There are two ways in which githook-perltidy behaviour may affect your
    existing workflow.

    *   If you are accustomed to commiting changes to files which are still
        open in your editor, your editor may complain that the underlying file
        has changed on disk. Possibily your editor doesn't even detect the
        change and your next write will not be 'tidy'.

    *   Aborting a commit with an empty commit message or via a later command
        in the pre-commit hook will still result in changed (tidied) files on
        disk and in the index.

FILES
    .perltidyrc
        Perltidy command options file.

    .perltidyrc.sweetend
        Perltidier (Perl::Tidy::Sweetened) command options file. Conflicts
        with .perltidyrc.

    .podtidy-opts
        Podtidy command options file. This is githook-perltidy specific.

    .readme_from
        Automatic README config file. This is githook-perltidy specific.
