NAME
    githook-perltidy - run perltidy and podtidy before Git commits

VERSION
    0.11.6 (2018-06-28)

SYNOPSIS
    Make sure everyone uses the same tidy options across your project:

        $ perltidy -b -w -dop | grep -v dump-options > .perltidyrc
        $ echo '--columns 72' > .podtidy-opts
        $ git add .perltidyrc .podtidy-opts
        $ git commit

    Install the pre-commit hook:

        $ githook-perltidy install

DESCRIPTION
    githook-perltidy is a script that can be invoked by Git pre-commit hook
    to run perltidy and podtidy on Perl and POD files (and optionally run
    make(1) targets), ensuring that your project's code is always cleanly
    committed.

    This script is is efficient: it only modifies Perl and POD files that
    are being committed and not every file in your repository. It also tries
    its hardest to be safe: tidying is performed on a separate working tree
    so that your own working files are not left in a bad state in the event
    of failure.

    There are two types of action this script will take as determined by the
    first argument:

    install [--force, -f] [MAKE ARGS]
        Should be run from the command-line in the top-level directory of
        your repository. Writes pre-commit and post-commit files in the
        $GIT_DIR/hooks/ directory. Any MAKE ARGS given will be added to the
        "githook-perltidy pre-commit" call.

        This command will fail if there is no .perltidyrc file in the
        repository or if the hooks directory isn't found. It will also fail
        if either of the hook files already exist, unless "--force" is used.

    pre-commit [MAKE ARGS]
        Called from a Git pre-commit hook. Checks out your index to a
        temporary working directory. Runs perltidy on any Perl files in the
        Git index using the .perltidyrc. If .podtidy-opts exists then
        podtidy will also be run on any POD files in the Git index. Any
        tidying errors stop the commmit. Otherwise the index and your
        working tree are updated with tidied files.

        If any MAKE ARGS are given they will be passed to a make call. This
        way you can ensure that your code passes a "make test" or "make
        disttest" check before each commit. If the PERLTIDY_MAKE environment
        variable exists it will *override* any arguments. Setting
        PERLTIDY_MAKE="" will skip the make call entirely.

        This command will fail if there is no .perltidyrc file in the
        repository.

    There is also a "post-commit" command left over from earlier versions
    that now does nothing and can be ignored.

OPTIONS
    --verbose, -v
        Print underlying Git commands or filesystem actions as they are run.

CAVEATS
    There are two ways in which githook-perltidy behaviour may affect your
    existing workflow. Firstly if you are accustomed to commiting changes to
    files which are still open in your editor, your editor may complain that
    the underlying file has changed on disk. Possibily your editor doesn't
    even detect the change and your next write will not be 'tidy'.

    Secondly, aborting a commit with an empty commit message or via a later
    command in the pre-commit hook will still result in changed (tidied)
    files on disk and in the index.

FILES
    .perltidyrc
        Perltidy command options file.

    .podtidy-opts
        Podtidy command options file. This is githook-perltidy specific.
