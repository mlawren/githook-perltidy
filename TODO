Things to do:

- Fix git version problem?

- Check that current branch is not (no branch)

- Also tidy up on renames, as they show up only as renames even if the
  file got modified as well.

- Detect modified .perltidyrc or .podtidy-opts files and error out

- Investigate use of git attribute filters
