=head1 NAME

githook-perltidy - run perltidy and podtidy before Git commits

=head1 VERSION

0.11.11_2 (2018-07-27)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    githook-perltidy COMMAND [OPTIONS...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<githook-perltidy> is a script designed to run from a Git pre-commit
hook. It ensures that your Perl and POD files are always cleanly
commited by running L<perltidy> (L<Perl::Tidy>) and L<podtidy>
(L<Pod::Tidy>) on them.

This script is is efficient: it only modifies files that are being
committed and not every file in your repository. It also tries its
hardest to be safe: tidying is performed in a temporary location so
that your own working files are not left in a bad state in the event of
failure.

=head2 Repository Setup

Before you can use B<githook-perltidy> you need to make sure everyone
working on your code uses the the same L<Perl::Tidy> and L<Pod::Tidy>
options:

    $ perltidy -b -w -dop | grep -v dump-options > .perltidyrc
    $ echo '--columns 72' > .podtidy-opts
    $ echo '^\.perltidyrc' >> MANIFEST.SKIP
    $ echo '^\.podtidy-ops' >> MANIFEST.SKIP
    $ git add .perltidyrc .podtidy-opts MANIFEST.SKIP
    $ git commit -m 'githook-perltidy support' && git push

=head3 Sweeter Tidying

You may prefer to tidy with L<Perl::Tidy::Sweetened> instead of plain
L<Perl::Tidy>. To enable that you commit a F<.perltidyrc.sweetened>
file instead of F<.perltidyrc>. B<githook-perltidy> does not depend on
L<Perl::Tidy::Sweetened> directly so you will want to add that as an
explicit "develop" dependency in your F<cpanfile>, F<Makefile.PL> or
F<Build.PL>.

=head3 Critical Checks

You may additionally wish to have L<Perl::Critic> run against your
commits.  To enable that you simply commit a F<.perlcriticrc> file to
the repository.  B<githook-perltidy> does not depend on L<Perl::Critic>
directly so you will want to add that as an explicit "develop"
dependency in your F<cpanfile>, F<Makefile.PL> or F<Build.PL>.

=head3 README from POD

B<githook-perltidy> also has an automatic README-from-POD feature. To
enable it you create and commit a file called F<.readme_from>
containing the name of the source file containing POD text:

    $ echo 'lib/Your/App.pm' > .readme_from
    $ echo '^\.readme_from' >> MANIFEST.SKIP
    $ git add .readme_from MANIFEST.SKIP
    $ git commit -m 'githook-perltidy readme_from' && git push

With the above in place the F<README> file will be updated (and
potentially committed) whenever F<lib/Your/App.pm> is committed.

=head2 githook-perltidy install [--force, -f]

Anyone making commits in a setup repository should ensure
B<githook-perltidy> runs from their pre-commit script. The C<install>
command can be used to create one, and must be run from the top-level
directory of your repository. It writes a F<pre-commit> file in the
F<$GIT_DIR/hooks/> directory.

    $ githook-perltidy install
    $ cat .git/hooks/pre-commit
    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/local/bin/githook-perltidy pre-commit

This command fails if there is no F<.perltidyrc> or
F<.perltidyrc.sweetened> file in the repository or if the hooks
directory isn't found. It will also fail if the Git F<pre-commit>
already file exists, unless C<--force> is used to replace it.

=head2 githook-perltidy pre-commit

The C<pre-commit> command loops through the Git index, checking out
files to a temporary working directory. For each temporary file it
then:

=over

=item * Runs L<perlcritic> if it is a Perl file and F<.perlcriticrc> exists.

=item * Runs L<perltidy> if it is a Perl file, unless
L<.perltidy-sweet> exists in which case L<perltidy-sweet> is run instead.

=item * Runs L<podtidy> if it is a Perl or a Pod file and
F<.podtidy-opts> exists.

=item * Updates the Git index (C<git add $TEMP_FILE>)

=item * Runs L<perltidy> and/or L<podtidy> on your working tree file of
the same name. This prevents future C<git diff> calls from showing
diffs where there won't actually be any.

=item * If F<.readme_from> exists and the file named therein is tidied, then
B<githook-perltidy> translates it with L<Pod::Text> into a new README
file. If the README file is tracked by Git then it is also added it to
the index for committing.

=back

Any tidying or critique error stops the script (and therefore the
commit) immediately. Any successful cleanups to the index and working
tree up until that point remain in place.

This command fails if there is no F<.perltidyrc> or
F<.perltidyrc.sweetened> file in the repository.

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

=over

=item --verbose, -v

Print underlying Git commands or filesystem actions as they are run.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

There are two ways in which B<githook-perltidy> behaviour may affect
your existing workflow.

=over

=item * If you are accustomed to commiting
changes to files which are still open in your editor, your editor may
complain that the underlying file has changed on disk. Possibily your
editor doesn't even detect the change and your next write will not be
'tidy'.

=item * Aborting a commit with an empty commit message or via a later
command in the pre-commit hook will still result in changed (tidied)
files on disk and in the index.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<.perltidyrc>

Perltidy command options file.

=item F<.perltidyrc.sweetend>

Perltidier (L<Perl::Tidy::Sweetened>) command options file. Conflicts
with F<.perltidyrc>.

=item F<.podtidy-opts>

Podtidy command options file. This is githook-perltidy specific.

=item F<.readme_from>

Automatic README config file. This is githook-perltidy specific.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item NO_GITHOOK_PERLTIDY

Setting this to 1 makes B<githook-perltidy> a no-op. Useful if you want
to make a non-tidy commit.
